> # Update Information (Latest listed first)
> ### v1.0.1
> - Fixed the vanilla "bug" with the stack size. They forced the stack of the fish to be 1, regardless of the fact the stack was 8 while in your inventory. If you dropped the item you'd only get 1 fish back no matter what. This is now fixed.
> ### v1.0.0
> - Initial Release
